	<h1>Hi, I'm Alex Trost and I'm a 2nd Grade Teacher passionate about making things easier for teachers and students.</h1>
				<p>Our kids take a LOT of tests, and some of them give teachers hundreds of points of data. I realized that parsing through all the data was a perfect task for a program. So one summer I learned Python and Django, along with HTML and CSS in order to make a webapp for my class. Ever since I've been learning as much as I can.</p>
