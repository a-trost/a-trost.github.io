So this is the first post, serving both as a test of the blog itself as well as a declaration of purpose.

This blog is (mostly) going to act as what I'll call a Learning Journal. As I continue to learn software development this will serve as a place to put down what I've learned, what I'm working on, general progress, thoughts, questions, etc. 

It'll be messy, but it'll help the process. Thanks for taking a look.
