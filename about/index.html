title: What I'm doing now

<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>I'm living in New Haven, Connecticut, trying to live a habit-based life with my wife and my dog. These are the things I spend my time on:</p>
<ul>
<li>I teach second grade at Booker T. Washington Academy. Trying to help my students and fellow teachers reach their goals.</li>
<li>I've been learning computer programming since June, 2016. I made a webapp with Python & Django to help the teachers at my school. It's grown into a bigger project and I've found I really love solving problems with code. Most of my free time goes towards learning about coding and computer science.</li>
<li>I'm currently writing 500+ words in the morning, 5 days a week. Eventually it'll turn into blog posts, articles, etc.</li>
<li>I married Ellen in July 2017 in a very small, family only wedding. We're doing a slightly bigger one in July, 2018.</li>
</ul>
