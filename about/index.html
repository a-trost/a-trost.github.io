title: What I'm doing now

<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>I'm living in New Haven, Connecticut, trying to live a habit-based life with my wife and my dog.</p>

<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>I teach second grade at Booker T. Washington Academy. Great group of kids.</p>

<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>I've been learning/doing computer programming since June, 2016. I made a webapp with Python & Django to help the teachers at my school. It's grown into a bigger project and I've found I really love solving problems with code. All of my free time goes towards learning about coding and computer science.</p>

<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>Never been a great writer, so I'm currently forcing myself to write 500+ words a day, 5 days a week. Eventually it'll turn into blog posts, articles, etc.</p>

<h2>Marriage</h2>
<p>I married Ellen in July 2017 in a very small, family only wedding. We're doing a slightly bigger one in July, 2018.</p>
